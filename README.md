# FXTL Points Dashboard

Welcome to the FXTL Points Dashboard, the central hub for managing and earning FXTL points within the Fraxtal ecosystem. FXTL is a unique ticker representing points that reward and incentivize users for their activity and contributions on Fraxtal.

## Features

### Earning FXTL Points

Earn FXTL points through various actions on the Fraxtal network:

- **Creating and Interacting with Smart Contracts:** Engage with the Fraxtal ecosystem by deploying and using smart contracts.
- **Utilizing New Protocols:** Explore and leverage new protocols deployed on the chain.
- **Holding Specific Types of Assets/Tokens:** Earn points by holding certain assets or tokens within your wallet.

The Flox blockspace incentives system further rewards users and developers for their gas usage. Every epoch (initially 7 days), addresses that spend gas and contracts that use gas receive proportional FXTL point rewards based on the Flox algorithm. This algorithm calculates transaction traces of gas used by smart contracts and applies a ranking system to determine contract importance and other criteria like held assets. Users can earn more FXTL points than the gas they spend, and developers can earn more than the gas their dApps use.

### Managing FXTL Points

Track and manage your FXTL points through the main FraxtalPoints contract, which serves as the ledger for all FXTL-related transactions and balances. The FXTL Points Dashboard provides a user-friendly interface with the following key features:

- **View Total FXTL Points Earned:** Keep track of your total accumulated points.
- **Track FXTL Point Accrual Over Time:** Monitor your points' growth over time.
- **Analyze FXTL Earnings by Activity Type:** Break down your earnings by activity, such as contracts created or gas spent.
- **Compare FXTL Earnings:** See how your earnings stack up against other participants.

## Future Plans

FXTL points will be tokenized no later than 12 months after Fraxtal chain genesis. The specifics of this tokenization are yet to be determined, but potential plans include:

- **Issuing FXTL as a Staking Token:** FXTL may be issued as a separate staking token for the Fraxtal chain.
- **Converting FXTL to FXS Tokens:** FXTL points might be converted to FXS tokens at a specified ratio.
- **Combination of Both:** A hybrid approach may be considered.

The FXTL Points Dashboard will continue to evolve, supporting the tokenization of FXTL points and providing more advanced features for managing and earning FXTL.

## Conclusion

By incentivizing users and developers through the FXTL Points System and Flox algorithm, Fraxtal aims to attract significant assets and emerge as a leading layer 2 blockchain. Start earning and managing your FXTL points today to be a part of this exciting journey!
